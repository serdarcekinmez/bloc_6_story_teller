# Bloc 6 Story Generator

 
For the architecture and methodology of the project,
please refer to our [explainer video](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/CyTd28LRUQVasx3AoUW4Eg).


This project is a branching story generator built on a Facebook Opt350 base model. 
We fine-tuned the model using creepy pasta horror stories, and applied ranking and sentiment analysis to output the best sequential sentences.

The story generator was created as part of a collaborative group project. 
Special thanks to my collaborators for their hard work and dedication:
- Morgane Berrod
- Nizar Sayad
- Lionel Shaghlil
