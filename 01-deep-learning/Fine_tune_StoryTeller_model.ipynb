His powerful symbiote had really muscled out for some reason and gained the additional 40 pounds when it formed the extra arms. Everyone had the extra arms regardless of his or her muscular new size, though. J had been richly rewarded for finding a missing diamond wedding ring and returning it to the couple it belonged to three days after being infected and “suited up” by his symbiote and gave most of his reward money to a charity that helped Christian refugees escape unspeakable and horrific persecution in war-torn countries. Many of these people had been rescued with this donation and J’s feeder insect business was thriving. J was able to use the money he earned from selling feeder insects to go diving for tasty lionfish and other prized underwater game. With his symbiote he didn’t need a wetsuit, fins, or dive mask for seeing underwater and could stay where the fish he hunted were for much longer. J’s symbiote formed an organic dive mask and organic fins when he dove and enabled him to stay underwater for hours at a time without scuba gear by storing oxygen which it released into his bloodstream while he was underwater.',\n",

    "\n",
    "**max_new_tokens=70**: This parameter sets the maximum number of new tokens in the generated text. It limits the length of the output to a specific number of tokens. This can be useful to prevent overly long or verbose responses.\n",

    "**temperature=0.7**: The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the text generation process. A higher temperature value (greater than 1.0) makes the generated output more diverse and random, while a lower value (less than 1.0) makes it more focused and deterministic. Here, the temperature is set to 0.7, indicating a moderate level of randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**top_k=50**: The top_k parameter specifies the number of top-k words to consider during text generation. It restricts the sampling pool to the most probable k words at each step. A higher value of top_k allows for more diversity in the generated text, while a lower value makes the output more focused and deterministic.\n",
    "in other words if you choose a low number you will have a poor voacbulary because you have limited the number of words to choose from the corpus of the model and vice-versa\n",
    "\n",
    "**top_p=0.95**: The top_p, takes the commulative probablity of all probable roots , also known as  \"p-coverage\" approach, is an alternative to top_k. It considers a cumulative probability distribution and chooses from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the given threshold (top_p). A higher value of top_p allows for more diverse and varied outputs, while a lower value makes the output more focused.\n",
    "\n",
    "**num_return_sequences=3**: This parameter specifies the number of distinct sequences or responses to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally a new parameter has been introduced recently , which we used in our project called penalty alpha, it has a beautiful technique that applies a penalty on the words which the model just used, meaning it will not use them until after a while. consequently we can avoid unnecessary repetition and the text becomes more creative\n",
